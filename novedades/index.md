Jekyll uses the Liquid Template System built by Shopify. You’ll notice a few weird tags in the HTML markup above composed of two sets of curly braces. If you’ve ever used Handlebars, Mustache.js, or similar “mustache” template libraries, Liquid will be familiar.

If you want to output a variable, you surround the variable’s name with two “mustaches,” or curly braces. For example, to output the website’s name, you’d write {{ site.name }} in the layout as shown above.

Jekyll has three main “global” variables that are always available for Liquid templates to use: site, page, and content. There’s also paginator, but we’ll use that one later.

The site variable corresponds to the configuration file (_config.yml) values. Because we placed a field called name in the _config.yml file, it is accessible through site.name. The same is true with each page’s front matter. If you would like to output a page’s title, you would use {{ page.title }}, because the name of the field in the page’s front matter is title.

If you go back to your web browser, you’ll see nothing has changed. This is because, while we’ve created a layout, we haven’t specified index.md should use this new layout. Go ahead and open index.md and add the following line to the front matter of the page:

layout: default
The name of the layout is simply the file name of the layout inside of the _layouts folder, minus the extension. In this case, default.html is referenced by “default”. If you refresh, your site should look like the following.
